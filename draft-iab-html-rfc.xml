    <abstract>
      <t>In order to meet the evolving needs of the Internet community, the
        format for RFCs is changing from a plain-text, ASCII-only format to a
        canonical XML format that will in turn be rendered into several
        publication formats. This document defines the HTML format that will
        be rendered for an RFC or Internet-Draft.</t>
    </abstract>

    <section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>As described in <xref target="I-D.iab-rfc-framework"/>, the RFC
        Series is changing. One of those changes includes the RFC Editor
        publishing a non-canonical HTML version of RFCs.</t>
      <t>This document describes the HTML format that will be used as one of the
        publication formats for the RFC Series. It defines a strict subset of
        HTML appropriate for RFC Series documents.  The visual layout of the
        document will be defined through a cascading style sheet (CSS)
        <xref target="W3C.REC-CSS2-20110607"/>.  The CSS will be included in the
        HTML file but will be described in a separate document.</t>
      <t>The details (particularly any vocabularies) described in this document
        are expected to change based on experience gained in implementing the
        RFC production center's toolset. Revised documents will be published
        capturing those changes as the toolset is completed. Other implementers
        must not expect those changes to remain backwards-compatible with the
        details described this document.</t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="requirements-for-html" title="Requirements for the HTML Format">
      <t>This section lists the design requirements used to create the HTML
        format described in this document.  These requirements build on those
        found in <xref target="RFC6949"/>. Many of these requirements are
        naturally fulfilled by using the output of the prep tool
        <xref target="I-D.hoffman-rfcv3-preptool"/>.</t>
      <t>
      <list style="symbols">
      <t>The HTML has to render correctly on a list of browser versions that
        the RFC Editor will keep up to date outside of this document.</t>
      <t>The format will consist of a subset of HTML deemed to be widely
        implemented   by common browsers at the time the specification is
        created, likely to continue to be widely-implemented, and unlikely to
        cause security issues.  This will maximize the chances that future HTML
        renderers (such as new web browsers) will continue to produce readable
        text from the HTML format without the format needing to be changed
        frequently.</t>
      <t>These requirements are expected to change in the future to reflect the
        expectation that HTML rendering will be required for current versions of
        browsers and platforms, while ideally continuing to render correctly on
        recent versions of those browsers.</t>
      <t>The HTML documents from the RFC Editor or Internet-Drafts directory
        may be re-rendered from the canonical XML format in
        the future to ensure the ongoing readability of the documents.  The
        intent is that any re-rendering would be due to exceptional
        circumstances rather than for minor annoyances.</t>
      <t>The HTML must display adequately in at least one text-based browser.
        Some consumers of the RFC series can only access the series on
        text-based terminals.</t>
      <t>The HTML document will be self-contained, without requiring external
        files for images, CSS, JavaScript, or the like.  This will allow
        the HTML file to be moved over various non-HTTP transports (such as
        e-mail, FTP, and rsync) without breakage.</t>
      <t>Any use of JavaScript in the HTML document must not be required for
        comprehensive reading of the document, because some consumers of the
        RFC series routinely disable JavaScript for security purposes.</t>
      <t>The HTML document will allow easy local override of the default CSS
        formatting.  This will allow users who have a different visual style
        that they prefer to make RFCs display with that style without having to
        alter the contents of the HTML document.  This might also be valuable
        for allowing people with specific accessibility needs to use a
        customized CSS.</t>
      <t>HTML tags in documents will rarely have attributes whose only purpose
        is to affect the rendered styling, and those will only be used if it
        would not be possible to specify that styling in CSS.  No such attributes are known at this time.</t>
      <t>Both user-defined and auto-generated anchors must be supported and
        linkable, with user-defined anchors appearing in an "id" attribute.
        Auto-generated anchors will be generated for every heading, paragraph,
        and so on, not just those that do not have user-defined anchors.
        User-defined anchors may, and auto-generated anchors will, appear next to
        paragraphs, figures, tables, blockquotes, and section titles.</t>
      <t>All section, subsections, figures, and paragraphs should have stable
        numbered link anchors.  Additionally, anchors expressed in the source
        XML should be exposed as anchors in the HTML output as well.</t>
      <t>The HTML must make it easy to separate sections along with all of their
        subsections into separate files.  This will make creating EPUB
        documents easier in the future.</t>
      <t>The HTML produced for Internet-Drafts will differ fromt that produced
        by the RFC Editor due to differences in the output from the prep tool.</t>
      <t>The abstract must be marked up or tagged in a way that popular search
        engines will extract it as a summary.</t>
      </list>
      </t>
      <section anchor="accessibility" title="Requirements for Accessibility">
        <t>
        <list style="symbols">
        <t>Normative information must be easily accessible to the following
          consumers:
          <list>
            <t>People with impaired vision, including those that use large fonts
              and those that use screen readers</t>
            <t>People with difficulty distinguishing between colors</t>
            <t>People who use devices with small screens, such as cell phones</t>
            <t>Other groups to be determined later</t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>Specific instances where goals for accessibility are important in the
          design choices of the format have been called out in the text.</t>
        <t>NOTE: designing for these consumers does not preclude the use of
          features they cannot use, but does require that key semantic data is not
          lost when read using the tools and settings that are required by a given
          constituency.</t>

    <section anchor="html5" title="HTML Version">
      <t>The RFC Editor will periodically determine which version of the
        HTML specification will be referenced for tools generating the
        format defined in this document.  The starting version will be that
        defined in <xref target="W3C.REC-html5-20141028"/>, commonly known as
        "HTML5".  Although the HTML specification mandates several of the syntax
        and structure rules described in this document, they are called out here
        for emphasis.</t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="syntax" title="HTML Syntax">
      <t>The processor emitting HTML from the XML source will follow these
        rules:</t>
      <t>
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>The HTML output is encoded as UTF-8, as specified in
            <xref target="RFC3629"/>.</t>
          <t>The document is valid HTML.</t>
          <t>Double quotes (U+0022 QUOTATION MARK: ") are used to quote attribute
            values unless the HTML specification forbids quoting a particular
            attribute.</t>
          <t>Each logical line is terminated solely with a \n (U+000A: LINE
            FEED), otherwise known as "Unix-style" line endings.</t>
          <t>Code points below (U+0020: SPACE) or character entity references
            that generate them (e.g. &amp;#9;), other than (U+000A: LINE FEED)
            may not be used.  NOTE: this rule explicitly forbids \t (U+0009:
            CHARACTER TABULATION), \f (U+000C: FORM FEED), and \r (U+000D:
            CARRIAGE RETURN) from appearing in the HTML output.</t>
          <t>Comments in the source XML, if any, will not be copied into
            the HTML.</t>
          <t>The HTML output will be pretty-printed, using whatever
            consistent rules are deemed best by the developers of the HTML
            production tools.</t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>NOTE: none of these rules affect the rendered output of the HTML, but
        are intended to increase the chance that text comparison tools
        (e.g. "diff") that operate on the HTML output easier to write.</t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="common" title="Common Items">
      <t>This section lists items that are common across multiple parts of the HTML
        document.</t>
      <section anchor='ids' title='IDs'>
        <t>HTML elements that are generated from XML elements that include
          an "anchor" attribute will use the value of the "anchor" attribute
          as the value of the "id" attribute of the corresponding HTML element.
          The prep tool produces XML with "anchor" attributes in all elements that need them.
          Some HTML constructs (such as
          &lt;section&gt;) will use
          multiple instances of these identifiers.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor='pilcrows' title='Pilcrows'>
        <t>Each paragraph, artwork, or sourcecode segment outside of a
          &lt;figure&gt; or &lt;table&gt; element will be appended with a
          space and a "pilcrow" (U+00B6: PILCROW SIGN), otherwise known as a
          "paragraph sign".  For the purposes of clarity in ASCII renderings
          of this document, in this document pilcrows are rendered as
          "&amp;para;".  The pilcrow will linked to the "id" attribute on the
          XML entity to which it is associated using an &lt;a&gt; element of
          class "pilcrow".  For example:</t>
        <figure>
          <artwork><![CDATA[
<p id="p-1.1-1">
  Some paragraph text. <a class="pilcrow" href="#p-1.1-1">&para;</a>
</p>]]></artwork>
        </figure>
        <t>The pilcrow will normally be invisible unless the element it is
          attached to is moused over.  The pilcrow will be surrounded by a
          link that points to the element it is attached to.</t>
        <t>Pilcrows are never included inside a &lt;table&gt; or
          &lt;figure&gt; elements, since the figure number or table number
          serve as adequate link targets.</t>
        <t>Elements that might otherwise contain a pilcrow do not get marked
          with a pilcrow if they contain one or more child elements that are
          marked with a pilcrow. For example:</t>
        <figure>
          <artwork><![CDATA[
<blockquote id="p-1.2-1">
  <p id="p-1.2-2">Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought
    forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and
    dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.
    <a href="#p-1.2-2" class="pilcrow">&para;</a></p>
  <!-- NO pilcrow here -->

      <section anchor="ascii-equivalents" title="ASCII Equivalents">
        <t>Many elements in the v3 schema in <xref target="I-D.hoffman-xml2rfc"/> contain attributes for
          ASCII equivalents of the Unicode text contained in the element or
          the Unicode attribute value.  These alternatives are included in the HTML as in a
          &lt;span&gt; tag with the class "ascii".  The &lt;span&gt; is

          an "href" attribute pointing to the "irefid" attribute of the &lt;iref&gt; element from the XML document. If the primary
