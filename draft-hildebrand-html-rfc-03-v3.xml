      <t>This document defines the HTML format that should be used for the production of Internet-Drafts and RFCs.  The HTML output will include a default CSS to enable page layout, and the HTML itself includes semantic information only.  This format will be rendered from the canonical XML format for an RFC.</t>

      <section anchor="background"><titleelement>Background</titleelement>
        <t>The RFC Series has been in existence for over 40 years.  During much of that time, the limitations of character set, line and page length, and graphics restrictions of RFC documents met the most immediate needs of the majority of authors and readers.  As technology changed, new formats that allowed for a richer set of edit, search and display features came in to use, and tools were created to convert the plain ASCII documents to other desired formats such as HTML, PDF, and Microsoft Word.  While the converted versions of the RFCs are widely available, the canonical display format remains the plain text, ASCII, line-printer structured one.  </t>
        <t>In 2013, after a great deal of community discussion, the decision was made to shift from the plain text, ASCII-only canonical format to XML <xref target="I-D.hoffman-xml2rfc" format="default"/>.  Several different publication formats will be rendered from that canonical XML, including HTML, PDF, TXT, and EPUB. </t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="overview"><titleelement>Overview</titleelement>
        <t>This memo describes an HTML format that will be used as one of the publication formats for the RFC Series. It defines a strict subset of HTML appropriate for Internet-Draft and RFC Series documents, and serves as a comprehensive example of all of the HTML elements that are permissible.  The CSS that defines the visual layout, while included in the HTML file, will be described in a separate document <xref target="W3C.REC-CSS2-20110607" format="default"/>.  The HTML itself will represent semantic information only.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="terminology"><titleelement>Terminology</titleelement>
        <t>In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 <xref target="RFC2119" format="default"/>.</t>

    <section anchor="requirements-for-html"><titleelement>Requirements for HTML<titleelement>
      <t>The HTML has to render correctly on the following:</t>
      <t>
        <ul>
          <li>the latest released versions of Chrome, Firefox, and IE running on Windows 8 in November 2013</li>
          <li>the latest released versions of Chrome, Firefox, and Safari running on Mac OS X 10.9 in November 2013</li>
          <li>the latest released versions of Chrome and Safari running on iOS 7 in November 2013</li>
          <li>the latest released versions of Chrome and Firefox running on Ubuntu 13.10 in November 2013</li>
          <li>the latest released versions of Chrome and Firefox running on Android 4.1 in November 2013</li>
        </ul>
      </t>
      <t>These requirements are expected to change in the future to reflect the expectation that HTML rendering will be required for current versions of browsers and platforms, while ideally continuing to render correctly on earlier versions.</t>
      <t>The HTML document must preserve all semantic information that is in the canonical XML document. One use case is that preformatted text that has different tags in the XML will also be differentiable in the HTML, making it trivial to extract all of the (for example) ABNF in an RFC with a simple program.  Another use case is that someone who wants to write programs that will extract information from an RFC can do so equally well with the XML and HTML, and can choose the tool that uses one or the other format for input.</t>
      <t>The HTML document must come with a default, internal set of CSS formatting.  This will allow for a mostly-consistent display of RFCs across browsers.  It will also allow for the HTML file to be moved over different transports (such as e-mail) and have the result look the same.</t>
      <t>The HTML must display adequately in at least one text-based browser.  Any use of javascript must not negatively impact the ability to read the document.</t>
      <t>The HTML document must allow easy local override of the default CSS formatting.  This will allow users who have a different visual style that they prefer to make RFCs display with that style without having to alter the contents of the HTML document.  This might also be valuable for allowing people with specific accessibility needs to have custom CSS.</t>
      <t>No HTML tags in the document may have style information.  All style information must be done through "class" and "id" attributes, with the style for those represented in the CSS alone.  Exceptions can be made for formatting that is not possible in any other way in HTML5 <xref target="W3C.CR-html5-20130806" format="default"/>, such as table column widths.</t>
      <t>The HTML must make it easy to separate chunks into separate files.  This will make creating EPUB documents easier in the future.</t>
      <t>The output needs to be HTML5.  Language extensions might be acceptable after further discussion.  The RFC Editor will use an automated validating tool before publishing the HTML.  This requirement is not important for viewing with browsers, but is important for programs that will use the HTML format as input for processing.</t>
      <t>The HTML must not have any Javascript or other active code in &lt;script&gt; or &lt;object&gt; tags.</t>
      <t>All section, subsections, figures, and paragraphs should have stable numbered link anchors.  Additionally, anchors expressed in the source XML should be exposed as anchors in the HTML as well.</t>
      <t>The abstract must be marked up or tagged in a way that search engines will extract it as summary.</t>
      <t>Normative information must be easily accessible to the following consumers:</t>
      <t>
        <ul>
          <li>People wieh impaired vision, including those that use large fonts and those that use screen readers</li>
          <li>People with difficult;y distinguishing between colors</li>
          <li>People who use devices with small screens, such as cell phones</li>
          <li>Other groups TBD</li>
        </ul>
      </t>
      <t>Specific instances where these goals are important in the design choices of the format have been called out in the text.</t>
      <t>The HTML document does not require the inclusion of non-semantic information such as comments and processor instructions.  </t>
      <t>NOTE: designing for these consumers does not preclude the use of features they cannot use, but does require that key semantic data is not lost when read using the tools and settings that are required by a given constituency.</t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="html-format"><titleelement>HTML Format</titleelement>
      <t>The format specified here is a subset of HTML, deemed to be widely-implemented by common browsers at the time that the specification was created, likely to continue to be widely-implemented in the future, and unlikely to cause security issues.</t>
      <section anchor="syntax"><titleelement>Syntax</titleelement>
        <t>The following rules SHALL be enforced:</t>
        <t>
          <ul>
            <li>The HTML source MUST be encoded as UTF-8, as specified in RFC3629. Note that RFC3629 forbids "surrogate" codepoints in the range U+D800 to U+DFFF.</t>
            <li>The document MUST be valid HTML5. </li>
            <li>Single quotes (U+0027 APOSTROPHE: ') MUST be used to quote attribute values.  Unquoted attribute values MUST NOT be used.</li>
            <li>Each logical line MUST be terminated solely with a \n (U+000A: LINE FEED), otherwise known as "Unix-style" line endings.</li>
            <li>Other than \n (U+000A: LINE FEED), code points less than " " (U+0020: SPACE) (otherwise known as "control characters") MUST NOT be used.  Any character references that would generate these code points (e.g. ) MUST NOT be used. NOTE: this rule explicitly forbids \t (U+0009: CHARACTER TABULATION), \f (U+000C: FORM FEED), and \r (U+000D: CARRIAGE RETURN) from appearing in the source.</li>
            <li>Each text-containing element such as headings (&lt;h1&gt;-&lt;h6&gt;), paragraphs (&lt;p&gt;), or list items (&lt;li&gt;), MUST be serialized as a single line without wrapping.</li>
            <li>The contents of &lt;pre&gt; elements MUST NOT be modified by processing tools.  The following rules apply to all elements except for &lt;pre&gt;: <ul><li>HTML SHALL be indented using spaces (not tabs).</li><li>Each child element SHALL be indented two spaces more than its parent element, unless the child element is mixed with non-whitespace-only text children of the same parent element.</li></ul></li>
          </ul>
        </t>
        <t>NOTE: none of these rules affect the rendered output of the HTML, but are intended to increase the chance that multiple tools that process the format will generate identical syntax.  In turn, this will make difference tools that operate on the HTML source easier to write.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="basic-structure"><titleelement>Basic Structure</titleelement>
        <section anchor="html5"><titleelement>HTML5</titleelement>
          <t>The HTML comprising the document MUST be valid according to the latest version of the HTML specification at the time of publishing, starting with the version commonly known as HTML5.  Although the HTML specification mandates several of syntax and structure rules in this document, they are called out here for emphasis.</t>
        </section>
        <section anchor="doctype"><titleelement>DOCTYPE</titleelement>
          <t>The DOCTYPE of the document MUST be "html", which declares that the document is compliant with HTML5.  For better backward-compatibility, the about:legacy-compat system DTD should be specified.  Therefore the document will start with exactly this string:</t>
          <artwork>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html SYSTEM 'about:legacy-compat'&gt;
          </artwork>
          <t>The SYSTEM 'about:legacy-compat' portion MAY be dropped in the future if the tooling chosen to produce this format does not require it.</t>
        </section>
        <section anchor="root-element"><titleelement>Root Element</titleelement>
          <t>The root element of the document MUST be &lt;html&gt;.  This element SHOULD include a lang attribute, whose value is a RFC5646 language tag describing the natural language of the document.  For documents submitted to the RFC Series or Internet-Draft Series, the language tag MUST be "en", meaning "English". If the lang attribute is not present, its value should be taken to be "en".</t>
        </section>
        <section anchor="charset-declaration"><titleelement>Charset Declaration</titleelement>
          <t>In order to be correctly processed by browsers that load the HTML using a mechanism that does not provide a valid MIME content-type or charset, the HTML &lt;head&gt; element MUST contain a &lt;meta&gt; element, with charset attribute with value utf-8.  This will look like:</t>
          <artwork>
&lt;meta charset='utf-8' &gt;
          </artwork>
        </section>
        <section anchor="style"><titleelement>Style</titleelement>
          <t>The &lt;head&gt; SHOULD contain an embedded CSS stylesheet in a &lt;style&gt; element.  The styles in the stylesheet are to be set consistently between documents by the RFC Editor, according to the best practices of the day.  The RFC Editor SHALL choose a stylesheet that does not modify the meaning of the normative text of the document.  The RFC Editor SHALL make the stylesheet available via a standard protocol (e.g. HTTP or HTTPS) for ease of authorship.  However, when a document is submitted, external stylesheets (other than "local.css" as specified below) are NOT ALLOWED. The stylesheet itself MUST NOT be considered as normative information.</t>
          <t>To ensure consistent formatting, individual style attributes SHOULD NOT be used in the main portion of the document source except in highly exceptional circumstances; each use MUST be individually justified.</t>
          <t>Different readers of a specification will desire different tweaks to the stylesheet.  To facilitate this, the &lt;head&gt; SHOULD include a &lt;link&gt; to a stylesheet in the same directory as the HTML file, named "local.css", after the embedded stylesheet. Note that this "local.css" file will not exist for most users; browsers will correspondingly ignore this &lt;link&gt;.</t>
          <t>For example:</t>
          <artwork>
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;style type='text/css'&gt;
&lt;! --
    /* RFC-editor styles */
    --&gt;
&lt;/style&gt;
    &lt;link rel='stylesheet' type='text/css' href='local.css' /&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
          </artwork>
        </section>
        <section anchor="emphasis"><titleelement>Emphasis</titleelement>
          <t>Words or phrases may be emphasized using the &lt;em&gt; element, usually rendered as italics.  Strong emphasis may be donated with the &lt;strong&gt; element, which is usually rendered as boldface.  Underlining MUST NOT be used except for links, to avoid visual confusion.  Text-only emphasis such as "<strong>bold</strong>" MUST NOT be used.</t>
          <t>The RFC Editor will set a policy that reflects the current feelings of the community as to whether this emphasis markup is allowed in documents that are submitted for publication in the RFC series.</t>
        </section>
        <section anchor="comments"><titleelement>Comments</titleelement>
          <t>HTML comments MAY be used, but MUST NOT contain normative information.  One example is to clarify particular choices in the HTML format.  Example:</t>
          <artwork>
&lt;!-- Automatically generated: do not modify --&gt;
          </artwork>
        </section>
        <section anchor="sections"><titleelement>Sections</titleelement>
          <t>Each section of the document SHALL be formatted as a &lt;div&gt; tag, with a class attribute with value "section".  A document-unique, id attribute SHOULD be assigned to each section &lt;div&gt;. The id MAY be human-readable or generated.</t>
          <t>NOTE: HTML5 requires id attributes to be unique across an entire document.</t>
          <t>Each section &lt;div&gt; MUST contain a header tag (&lt;h2&gt;-&lt;h6&gt;) of the appropriate depth, with top-level sections getting an &lt;h2&gt; tag, and each nested section getting the next higher header level. If more than five levels of headers are required, &lt;h6&gt; MUST be used for each deeper-nested section. However, nesting sections more than five levels deep is NOT RECOMMENDED.</t>
          <t>The text in each header tag MUST begin with the section number. Section numbers MUST begin at "1.", and MUST increment by one for each successive section at the same level.  Subsections MUST be numbered by appending the subsection number to the parent section number.</t>
          <t>It is RECOMMENDED that the section number be wrapped in an &lt;a&gt; element, whose href attribute points to the corresponding section div with a local relative reference.  This &lt;a&gt; element SHOULD have the CSS class self-ref.</t>
          <t>Within a section, each "normal" paragraph MUST be surrounded by a &lt;p&gt; element.</t>
          <t>For example:</t>
          <artwork>
&lt;div class='section' id='example'&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class='self-ref' href='#example'&gt;1.&lt;/a&gt;Example Section
  &lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is a description of the example&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;div class='section' id='nested'&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class='self-ref' href='#nested'&gt;1.1.&lt;/a&gt; Nested Section
    &lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a description of the nested section.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the second description paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; 
          </artwork>
          <t>Parent sections that contain child sections MUST NOT contain "normal" paragraphs after a sub-section.  For example, the following is invalid:</t>
          <artwork>
&lt;div class='section' id='example'&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class='self-ref' href='#example'&gt;1.&lt;/a&gt; Example Section
  &lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is a description of the example&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;div class='section' id='nested'&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class='self-ref' href='#nested'&gt;1.1.&lt;/a&gt;Nested Section
    &lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a description of the nested section.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;BAD PROSE!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
          </artwork>
        </section>
        <section anchor="appendices"><titleelement>Appendices</titleelement>
          <t>Appendices are special cases of top-level sections.  Each appendix of the document SHALL be formatted as a &lt;div&gt; tag, with a class attribute with value "appendix".  A document-unique, id attribute SHOULD be assigned to each section &lt;div&gt;.  The id MAY be human-readable or generated.  Each appendix &lt;div&gt; MUST contain an &lt;h2&gt; element containing text that describes the purpose of the appendix.  Appendices are identified to the reader with Latin capital letters A-Z, in order.  It is NOT RECOMMENDED to have more than 26 appendices, but if required, appendices "AA.", "AB.", etc. follow Appendix Z.</t>
          <t>Inside the appendix, subsections MUST be formatted per Sections, numbered sequentially.  For example, the first subsection of "Appendix A." is "Appendix A.1.".</t>
          <t>For example:</t>
          <artwork>
&lt;div class='appendix' id='acknowledgements'&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;Appendix A. Acknowledgements&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The author gratefully acknowledges the contributions of...&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;div class='section' id='contributors'&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;Appendix A.1. Contributors&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These people contributed text...&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
          </artwork>
        </section>
        <section anchor="paragraphs"><titleelement>Paragraphs</titleelement>
          <t>Paragraphs MUST be contained in a section &lt;div&gt; or an appendix &lt;div&gt;.  A document-unique, id attribute SHOULD be assigned to each &lt;p&gt;.  The id will usually be machine-generated, but MAY be human-readable if desired.</t>
          <t>It is RECOMMENDED that each paragraph be kept relatively small compared to a "page" in previous RFC formats, so that references to each paragraph are at least as valuable as page references have been in previous formats.</t>
        </section>
        <section anchor="lists"><titleelement>Lists</titleelement>
          <t>Lists may be used inside a section &lt;div&gt;, and may nest in other lists as needed.  However, lists MUST NOT be nested inside a &lt;p&gt; element.  Unordered lists (&lt;ul&gt;) and ordered lists (&lt;ol&gt;) may both be used.  For example:</t>
          <artwork>
&lt;div class='section' id='lists'&gt;
  &lt;h4&gt;Unordered list&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;p id='lists-p-1'&gt;An explanation:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;One&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Two&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Two.1: (this one is numbered)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
          </artwork>
        </section>
        <section anchor="references"><titleelement>References</titleelement>
          <t>Reference format must follow the guidance in the RFC Style Guide <xref target="I-D.iab-styleguide" format="default"/>.</t>
        </section>
        <section anchor="quotes"><titleelement>Quotes</titleelement>
          <t>Non-trivial direct quotes from other documents SHOULD use the &lt;blockquote&gt; element.  If the quote needs a citation, wrap the &lt;blockquote&gt; in a &lt;figure&gt; and add a &lt;figcaption&gt; element that contains text (and possibly links) that describe the quote.  For example, this code:</t>
          <artwork>
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here a &lt;code&gt;blockquote&lt;/code&gt; element
    is used in conjunction with a &lt;code&gt;figure&lt;/code&gt; element and
    its &lt;code&gt;figcaption&lt;/code&gt; to clearly relate a quote to its
    attribution (which is not part of the quote and therefore 
    doesn't belong
    inside the &lt;code&gt;blockquote&lt;/code&gt; itself):&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Sample Quote from &lt;a class='ref' href='#w3c:
  CR-html5-20130806'&gt;HTML5&lt;/a&gt;,
    section 4.5.4&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
          </artwork>
          <t>Would render as:</t>
          <figure anchor="Figure_1"><titleelement>Sample Quote from HTML5, section 4.5.4</titleelement>
            <artwork>
    Here a blockquote element is used in conjunction with a figure 
    element and its figcaption to clearly relate a quote to its 
    attribution (which is not part of the quote and therefore 
    doesn't belong inside the blockquote itself):

        <t>This section describes how to format several types of information that occur regularly in documents for the Internet-Draft and RFC Series which are not descriptive text.</t>
        <section anchor="requirement-keywords"><titleelement>Requirement Keywords</titleelement>
          <t>The RFC2119 keywords in the document MAY be set off with special markup.  If so, they MUST be surrounded with a &lt;span&gt; element containing the CSS class rfc2119. For example:</t>
          <t>If so, they &lt;span class='rfc2119'&gt;MUST&lt;/span&gt; be surrounded</t>
        </section>
        <section anchor="formatting-the-table-of-contents"><titleelement>Formatting the Table of Contents</titleelement>
          <t>The table of contents for the document MUST appear in a &lt;div&gt; element, which SHOULD precede any of the sections of proper document content.  The &lt;div&gt; element MUST have an id attribute with value toc.  The &lt;div&gt; element SHOULD contain an &lt;h2&gt; element containing the string Table of Contents, followed by nested &lt;ul&gt; and &lt;li&gt; elements describing the structure of the document, with links to each of the sections mentioned.  For example:</t>
          <artwork>
&lt;div id='toc'&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;Table of Contents&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;1. &lt;a href='#introduction'&gt;Introduction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;1.1. &lt;a href='#background'&gt;Background&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
        ...
          </artwork>
          <t>NOTE: the Table of Contents SHOULD NOT be considered meta-data for the document.  The sections themselves SHOULD contain all of the data that is required.</t>
        </section>
        <section anchor="svg"><titleelement>SVG</titleelement>
          <t>SVG can be included directly in the HTML source, surrounded by a &lt;figure&gt; element and succeeded by a &lt;figcaption&gt; element, as described in Section .  The root &lt;svg&gt; element MUST contain a &lt;title&gt; or &lt;desc&gt; element that fully describes the diagram for accessibility to screen readers; this is similar to the alt; attribute on images.  See "SVG Drawings for RFCs: SVG 1.2 RFC" for details on the appropriate SVG profile for use in RFCs <xref target="I-D.brownlee-svg-rfc" format="default"/>.</t>
        </section>

          <t>ASCII art is still preferred by some authors in preference to an image or SVG.  The RFC Editor may decide to prefer SVG, or may decide to prohibit ASCII art in the future, depending on the needs of the community at the time of publishing.

    <section anchor="document-metadata"><titleelement>Document Metadata</titleelement>
      <t>Metadata for the document SHOULD be easily extractable from the document by tools that ordinarily process HTML.  Typically, the class and id attributes can be used to query the document using CSS-style selectors.  The metadata scheme SHOULD be designed such that the element name is not required in order to select a given piece of data. Instead, any element that can contain text can be used for a given class or id to be selected.  The value of the data contained by the selected element(s) consists of the concatenation of all of the text from all of the child nodes of the selected element or elements, with each run of consecutive whitespace Unicode codepoints [codepoints with the White_Space property, such as U+0020 (SPACE), U+0009 (CHARACTER TABULATION), U+000A (LINE FEED), U+000C (FORM FEED), U+000D (CARRIAGE RETURN), U+00A0 (NON-BREAKING SPACE), and U+2029 (PARAGRAPH SEPARATOR)] compressed to a single U+0020 (SPACE).  The metadata scheme MUST allow unambiguous selection.</t>
      <t>The id attribute is used to identify pieces of data that are guaranteed to be unique across the document.  Any element with an id attribute can also be used as a fragment target in a URI by starting with the base URI of the document, then appending "#" (U+0023: NUMBER SIGN) and the value of the id attribute.  In CSS, the element with a given id attribute value is selected by prepending the value with "#" (U+0023: NUMBER SIGN).  For example, the following HTML in a document with the URI http://example.com/index.html:</t>
      <artwork>
&lt;div id='example'&gt;Important Text&lt;/div&gt;
      </artwork>
      <t>Can be targeted directly with the URL http://example.com/index.html#example, and the CSS selector #example.</t>
      <t>The class attribute is a catch-all tagging mechanism for everything in the document that might not be unique.  Multiple classes may be defined on a single element by setting the class attribute to a space-separated list of classes.  All of the elements with a given class name can be selected in CSS by prepending the class name with "." (U+002E: FULL STOP).</t>
      <section anchor="document-information"><titleelement>Document Information</titleelement>
        <t>Information about the document as a whole. The &lt;div&gt; element with id='document' SHOULD be the first child element of the HTML.  For example:</t>
        <artwork>
&lt;div id='document'&gt;
  &lt;div class='identifiers'&gt;
    &lt;div class='workgroup'&gt;Network Working Group&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class='series'&gt;Internet-Draft&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class='status'&gt;Standards Track&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class='published'&gt;2012-07-07&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class='expires'&gt;2013-01-07&lt;/div&gt;

The &lt;div&gt; element SHOULD contain an &lt;h2&gt; element containing the word Abstract, and MUST contain one or more &lt;p&gt; elements containing text that describes the document succinctly.  For example:</t>
        <artwork>
&lt;div id='abstract'&gt;

The &lt;div&gt; element MUST have an id attribute with value ipr and a CSS class of the name of the relevant IPR ruleset.  The only valid values for the IPR ruleset class are trust200902, noModificationTrust200902, and noDerivativesTrust200902 at this time.  The contents of the &lt;div&gt; element are to be set correctly for the given ruleset, based on guidance from the IETF trust.  For example:</t>

It captures the RFC Editor's basic requirements and offers guidance regarding the style and structure of an RFC.  Additional guidance is captured on a website that reflects the experimental nature of that guidance and prepares it for future inclusion in the RFC Style guide.  Guidance provided by this document will not be applied until published as an RFC.  Please send your comments about the contents of this document to &lt;rfc-interest@rfc-editor.org&gt;.</t>

    <date month="April" day="28" year="2014"/>
    <abstract><t>This document defines the 'XML2RFC' version 3 vocabulary; an XML- based language used for writing RFCs and Internet-Drafts.  It is heavily derived from the version 2 vocabulary that is also under discussion.  This document obsoletes the v2 grammar described in RFC 2629 and its expected followup, draft-reschke-xml2rfc.  Editorial Note (To be removed by RFC Editor)  Discussion of this draft takes place on the rfc-interest mailing list (rfc-interest@rfc-editor.org), which has its home page at &lt;https://www.rfc-editor.org/mailman/listinfo/rfc-interest&gt;.</t>
