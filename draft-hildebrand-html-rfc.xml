    <section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>As described in <xref target="I-D.flanagan-rfc-framework"/>, the RFC
        Series is changing. One of those changes includes the RFC Editor
        publishing a non-canonical HTML version of RFCs.</t>
      <t>This memo describes the HTML format that will be used as one of the
        publication formats for the RFC Series. It defines a strict subset of
        HTML appropriate for RFC Series documents.  The visual layout of the
        document will be defined through a cascading style sheet (CSS)
        <xref target="W3C.REC-CSS2-20110607"/>.  The CSS will be included in the
        HTML file but will be described in a separate document.</t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="requirements-for-html" title="Requirements for the HTML Format">
      <t>This section lists the design requirements used to create the HTML
        format described in this document.  These requirements build on those
        found in <xref target="RFC6949"/>.</t>
      <t>The HTML has to render correctly on a list of browsers versions that
        the RFC Editor will keep up to date outside of this document.</t>
      <t>These requirements are expected to change in the future to reflect the
        expectation that HTML rendering will be required for current versions of
        browsers and platforms, while ideally continuing to render correctly on
        earlier versions.</t>
      <t>The HTML documents may be re-rendered from the canonical XML format in
        the future to ensure the ongoing readability of the documents.  The
        intent is that any re-rendering would be due to exceptional
        circumstances rather than for minor annoyances.</t>
      <t>The HTML must display adequately in at least one text-based browser.
        Some consumers of the RFC series can only access the series on text-
        based terminals.</t>
      <t>The HTML document will be self-contained, without requiring external
        files for images, CSS, JavaScript, or the like.  This will allow
        the HTML file to be moved over various non-HTTP transports (such as
        e-mail, FTP, and rsync) without breakage.</t>
      <t>Any use of JavaScript in the HTML document will not negatively impact
        the ability to read the document.  Some consumers of the RFC series
        routinely disable JavaScript for security purposes.</t>
      <t>The HTML document will allow easy local override of the default CSS
        formatting.  This will allow users who have a different visual style
        that they prefer to make RFCs display with that style without having to
        alter the contents of the HTML document.  This might also be valuable
        for allowing people with specific accessibility needs to use a
        customized CSS.</t>
      <t>HTML tags in documents will rarely have attributes whose only purpose
        is to affect the rendered styling, and those will only be used if it
        would not be possible to specify that styling in CSS.</t>
      <t>Both user-defined and autogenerated anchors must be supported and
        linkable, with user-defined anchors appearing in an "id" attribute.
        Autogenerated anchors will be generated for every heading, paragraph,
        and so on, not just those that do not have user-defined anchors.
        User-defined anchors may, and autogenerated anchors will, appear next to
        paragraphs, figures, tables, blockquotes, and section titles.</t>
      <t>All section, subsections, figures, and paragraphs should have stable
        numbered link anchors.  Additionally, anchors expressed in the source
        XML should be exposed as anchors in the HTML as well.</t>
      <t>The HTML must make it easy to separate sections along with all of their
        subsections into separate files.  This will make creating EPUB
        documents easier in the future.</t>
      <t>The abstract must be marked up or tagged in a way that popular search
        engines will extract it as a summary.</t>
      <t>The format will consist of a subset of HTML deemed to be widely-
        implementd by common browsers at the time the specification is created,
        likely to continue to be widely-implemented, and unlikely to cause
        security issues.  This will maximize the chances that future HTML
        renderers (such as new web browsers) will continue to produce readable
        text from the HTML format without the format needing to be changed
        frequently.</t>
      <t>Normative information must be easily accessible to the following
        consumers:</t>
      <t>
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>People with impaired vision, including those that use large fonts
            and those that use screen readers</t>
          <t>People with difficulty distinguishing between colors</t>
          <t>People who use devices with small screens, such as cell phones</t>
          <t>Other groups TBD</t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>Specific instances where goals for accessibility are important in the
        design choices of the format have been called out in the text.</t>
      <t>NOTE: designing for these consumers does not preclude the use of
        features they cannot use, but does require that key semantic data is not
        lost when read using the tools and settings that are required by a given
        constituency.</t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="html5" title="HTML Version">
      <t>The RFC Editor will periodically determine which version of the
        HTML specification will be referenced for tools generating the
        format defined in this document.  The starting version will be that
        defined in <xref target="W3C.PR-html5-20140916"/>, commonly known as
        "HTML5".  Although the HTML specification mandates several of syntax
        and structure rules in this document, they are called out here for
        emphasis.</t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="syntax" title="HTML Syntax">
      <t>The processor emitting HTML from the XML source will follow these
        rules:</t>
      <t>
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>The HTML source is encoded as UTF-8, as specified in
            <xref target="RFC3629"/>.</t>
          <t>The document is valid HTML.</t>
          <t>Double quotes (U+0022 QUOTATION MARK: ") are used to quote attribute
            values unless the HTML specification forbids quoting a particular
            attribute.</t>
          <t>Each logical line is terminated solely with a \n (U+000A: LINE
            FEED), otherwise known as "Unix-style" line endings.</t>
          <t>Other than \n (U+000A: LINE FEED), code points less than " "
            (U+0020: SPACE) (otherwise known as "control characters") are not
            used.  Any character references that would generate these code
            points (e.g., &amp;#0009;) may not be used. NOTE: this rule
            explicitly forbids \t (U+0009: CHARACTER TABULATION), \f (U+000C:
            FORM FEED), and \r (U+000D: CARRIAGE RETURN) from appearing in the
            source.</t>
          <t>Comments in the canonical XML, if any, will not be copied into
            the HTML.</t>
          <t>The HTML source will be pretty-printed, using whatever
            consistent rules the tooling team deems best.</t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>NOTE: none of these rules affect the rendered output of the HTML, but
        are intended to increase the chance that difference tools that operate
        on the HTML source easier to write.</t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="prolog" title="Prologue">
      <t>The front matter of the HTML format contains processing information,
        metadata of various types, and styling information that applies to the
        document as a whole.  This section describes HTML that is not
        necessarily a direct transform from the XML format.  For more details

        see <xref target="elements"/>.</t>
      <section anchor="doctype" title="DOCTYPE">

            the HTML &lt;head&gt; element contains a &lt;meta&gt; element,

          <t>The &lt;head&gt; element contains an embedded CSS stylesheet in a
            &lt;style&gt; element.  The styles in the stylesheet are to be set
            consistently between documents by the RFC Editor, according to the
            best practices of the day.</t>
          <t>To ensure consistent formatting, individual style attributes are
            not used in the main portion of the document source except in
            highly exceptional circumstances; each use of such attributes will
            be individually justified.</t>
          <t>Different readers of a specification will desire different
            formatting when reading the HTML versions of RFCs.  To facilitate
            this, the &lt;head&gt; element also includes a &lt;link&gt; to a
            stylesheet in the same directory as the HTML file, named
            "rfc-local.css". Any formatting in the linked stylesheet will
            override the formatting in the included stylesheet.</t>
